## About The Project

Rocket Readouts is my first project of second year at Open Window DV200. Using React and Charts.js to make a SPA that visualises data from the SpaceX API. It has: a Dashboard (providing a summary of the data gained); a Compare page (that allows you to compare two objects - Rockets and Launchpads); a Timelines page visualising a number of data points over time and, lastly, a map displaying successful and unsuccessful launches at various launchpad sites using Leaflet.
